This ``Automatic-AC-Machine`` is designed to **copy** the **passed** code from one OJ to another OJ. For OJs using ``RemoteJudge`` , the number of submissions can be synchronized.
This program may manipulate the mouse position and clipboard, remember to open it again in a full-screen browser without zooming, and it is best not to move the mouse while it is running.
